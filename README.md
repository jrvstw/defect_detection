# DEFECT DETECTION SYSTEM

This is basically an implementation of the Paper "defect detection algorithm
for corner cracks in steel billet using discrete wavelet transform", with
some modifications that recognize 4 different types of cracks.

## Requirements:

* C++ Compiler
* Qt 4 development files

## Building executable

Run these in the directory of this README file to build an executable.
```bash
qmake-qt4 -project
qmake-qt4
make
```

## Operating instructions

* Space, right arrow to the next image.
* Backspace, left key to the previous image.
* Esc to close application.
