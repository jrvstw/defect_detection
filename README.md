# DEFECT DETECTION SYSTEM

This is basically an implementation of the Paper "defect detection algorithm
for corner cracks in steel billet using discrete wavelet transform", with
some modifications that recognize 4 different types of cracks.

## Requirements:

C++
Qt 4

## How to Run

run these in the directory of this README file.
```bash
qmake-qt4 -project
qmake-qt4
make
./defect_detection
```
